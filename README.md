# The Love Tracker

Do they love you? Do they not? Stop pulling petals out of your head and track where you stand with this simple click tracking app!

## Technologies Used

XCode 10.1

Swift 4.2


### Notes:

This project is an evolution of the "Hello app" from the Udemy course, .

Future aspirations: Cell rollovers/hovers that say "Loves me not" to establish the effect of clicking on the row. A tally, in case you are so loved it's hard to count. Good for you.
