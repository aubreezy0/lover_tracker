# The Love Tracker

Do they love you? Do they not? Stop pulling petals out of your head and track where you stand with this simple click tracking app!

## Technologies Used

XCode 10.1
Swift 4.2

### Notes:

This project is an evolution of the "Hello app" from the [Udemy XCode10 bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-10-day-iphone-app-bootcamp-new-ios-12-and-xcode-10).

Future aspirations: Cell rollovers/hovers that say "Loves me not" to establish the effect of clicking on the row. A tally, in case you are SO loved it's hard to count. Good for you.
